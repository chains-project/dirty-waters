### Call to Action:

<details>
    <summary>üëªWhat do I do now? </summary>
        For packages without source code & accessible release tags:

        Pull Request to the maintainer of dependency, requesting correct repository metadata and proper tagging.

For deprecated packages:

        1. Confirm the maintainer‚Äôs deprecation intention
        2. Check for not deprecated versions

For packages without provenance:

        Open an issue in the dependency‚Äôs repository to request the inclusion of provenance and build attestation in the CI/CD pipeline.

For packages that are forks

        Inspect the package and its GitHub repository to verify the fork is not malicious.

For packages without code signature:

        Open an issue in the dependency‚Äôs repository to request the inclusion of code signature in the CI/CD pipeline.

For packages with invalid code signature:

        It's recommended to verify the code signature and contact the maintainer to fix the issue.
